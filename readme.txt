Create content layouts and menus on a per-page or site-wide basis quickly using an intuitive post, page and widget admin interface. Quickly format page layouts using shortcodes instead of the block editor. This plugin is one part of a larger framework of WordPress features. 

== Description ==

IntelliWidget is a versatile WordPress plugin that makes your dynamic sidebars "page-specific." It allows you to create custom "Profiles" for any page or post that can be used where the default sidebar widget would normally appear. You set the rules for each profile to display custom widget content any way you want.

Use the shortcode option to put custom menus, featured posts and other dynamic content anywhere on your site.

Because it is generated using active titles and permalinks, your sidebar content is always current with the latest versions.

Select posts by title, date, category, tag, and many other ways. Combine with custom post types to create unlimited custom sidebar content. Combine with your favorite jQuery Slider plugin to display animated slideshows.

Reuse the settings from existing profiles to save hours of setup time.

With IntelliWidget you can add just a few widget areas and create unlimited per page custom menus and featured posts and other custom text.
